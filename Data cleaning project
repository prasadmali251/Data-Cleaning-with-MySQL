-- 1. Remove Duplicates

# First let's check for duplicates

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;


SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;


SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1;
    
-- let's just look at oda to confirm
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
WHERE company = 'Oda'
;
-- it looks like these are all legitimate entries and shouldn't be deleted. We need to really look at every single row to be accurate

-- these are our real duplicates 
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1;

-- these are the ones we want to delete where the row number is > 1 or 2or greater essentially

-- now you may want to write it like this:
WITH DELETE_CTE AS 
(
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1
)
DELETE
FROM DELETE_CTE
;


WITH DELETE_CTE AS (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) AS row_num
	FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
)
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
WHERE (company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, row_num) IN (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, row_num
	FROM DELETE_CTE
) AND row_num > 1;

-- one solution, which I think is a good one. Is to create a new column and add those row numbers in. Then delete where row numbers are over 2, then delete that column
-- so let's do it!!

ALTER TABLE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging ADD row_num INT;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
;

CREATE TABLE `world_layoffs`.`layoffs_staging2` (
`company` text,
`location`text,
`industry`text,
`total_laid_off` INT,
`percentage_laid_off` text,
`date` text,
`stage`text,
`country` text,
`funds_raised_millions` int,
row_num INT
);

INSERT INTO `world_layoffs`.`layoffs_staging2`
(`company`,
`location`,
`industry`,
`total_laid_off`,
`percentage_laid_off`,
`date`,
`stage`,

SELECT `company`,

		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;

-- now that we have this we can delete rows were row_num is greater than 2

DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE row_num >= 2;
